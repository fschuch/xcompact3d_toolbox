**Welcome to Xcompact3d-toolbox's documentation!**

It is a Python package designed to handle the pre and postprocessing of
the high-order Navier-Stokes solver Xcompact3d_. It aims to help users and
code developers to build case-specific solutions with a set of tools and
automated processes.

The physical and computational parameters are built on top of traitlets_,
a framework that lets Python classes have attributes with type checking, dynamically
calculated default values, and "on change" callbacks.
In addition to ipywidgets_ for an user friendly interface.

Data structure is provided by xarray_ (see `Why xarray?`_), that introduces labels
in the form of dimensions, coordinates and attributes on top of raw NumPy_-like
arrays, which allows for a more intuitive, more concise, and less error-prone
developer experience. It integrates tightly with dask_ for parallel computing and
hvplot_ for interactive data visualization.

Finally, Xcompact3d-toolbox is fully integrated with the new *Sandbox Flow Configuration*.
The idea is to easily provide everything that Xcompact3d needs
from a `Jupyter Notebook`_, like initial conditions, solid geometry, boundary
conditions, and the parameters. It makes life easier for beginners, that can run
any new flow configuration without worrying about Fortran and 2decomp_. For
developers, it works as a rapid prototyping tool, to test concepts and then
compare results to validate any future Fortran implementations.

Getting Started
===============

Installation
------------

It is possible to install using pip::

   pip install xcompact3d-toolbox

There are other dependency sets for extra functionality::

   pip install xcompact3d-toolbox[visu] # interactive visualization with hvplot and others

To install from source, clone de repository::

   git clone https://github.com/fschuch/xcompact3d_toolbox.git

And then install it interactively with pip::

   cd xcompact3d_toolbox
   pip install -e .

You can install all dependencies as well::

   pip install -e .[all]

Now, any change you make at the source code will be available at your local installation, with no need to reinstall the package every time.

Examples
--------

* Importing the package::

   import xcompact3d_toolbox as x3d

* Loading the parameters file (both :obj:`.i3d` and :obj:`.prm` are supported, see `#7 <https://github.com/fschuch/xcompact3d_toolbox/issues/7/>`_) from the disc::

   prm = x3d.Parameters(loadfile="input.i3d")
   prm = x3d.Parameters(loadfile="incompact3d.prm")

* Specifying how the binary fields from your simulations are named, for instance:

  * If the simulated fields are named like ``ux-000.bin``::

     prm.dataset.filename_properties.set(
        separator = "-",
        file_extension = ".bin",
        number_of_digits = 3
     )

  * If the simulated fields are named like ``ux0000``::

     prm.dataset.filename_properties.set(
        separator = "",
        file_extension = "",
        number_of_digits = 4
     )

* There are many ways to load the arrays produced by your numerical simulation, so you can choose what best suits your post-processing application.
  All arrays are wrapped into xarray_ objects, with many useful methods for indexing, comparisons, reshaping and reorganizing, computations and plotting.
  See the examples:

  * Load one array from the disc::

     ux = prm.dataset.load_array("ux-0000.bin")

  * Load the entire time series for a given variable::

     ux = prm.dataset["ux"]

  * Load all variables from a given snapshot::

     snapshot = prm.dataset[10]

  * Loop through all snapshots, loading them one by one::

     for ds in prm.dataset:
        # compute something
        vort = ds.uy.x3d.first_derivative("x") - ds.ux.x3d.first_derivative("y")
        # write the results to the disc
        prm.dataset.write(data = vort, file_prefix = "w3")

  * Or simply load all snapshots at once (if you have enough memory)::

     ds = prm.dataset[:]

* It is possible to produce a new xdmf file, so all data can be visualized on any external tool::

     prm.dataset.write_xdmf()


* User interface for the parameters with IPywidgets::

   prm = x3d.ParametersGui()
   prm
